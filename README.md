I have developed Last Fm Image Gallery With PHP. (which was specified in Test Description - (php only)).

You will need the php-environment-set-up to run the code. You can set it up in MAMP or Vagrant or any other services
you are familiar with.

The code has Two directories -
css - 3 files, php - 2 files
and two files index.php and README.md at root of code.

There are no external packages used. I have not used  PHP Last.fm API library as well as it was specified not to
use any external packages. Hence there is no special installation required to run this code.

By default, the code search with country "Australia". So Do not get surprise when you hit the page
for the first time and you see some results.
